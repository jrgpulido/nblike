 The ratio of the momentum to the velocity is
the relativistic mass, m.

![f1]

And the relativistic mass and the relativistic
kinetic energy are related by the formula:

![f2]

Einstein wanted to omit the unnatural second term
on the right-hand side, whose only purpose is
to make the energy at rest zero, and to declare
that the particle has a total energy, which obeys:
![f3] which is a sum of the rest energy ![f4]
and the kinetic energy.
